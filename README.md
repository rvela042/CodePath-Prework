**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Robert Velasquez

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

(I can also provide the Git URL if needed)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] If I was under the 5-hour limit, I would have definitely loved to add a feature where the background color
	of the website would change to a random set of colors depending if the user won or not.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
	While working on the project, I took the time to use the W3schools website - which was listed a few times on the instructions
	to better understand the CSS and HTML language. Additionally, I used the StackOverflow webpage to better understand the instructions
	that were given based off java.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
	During my time on the project, the only challenge I encountered was creating the nested if-else statements. Unfortunately, the tries
	that I took to get the code right were extremely close. However, after comparing the code that I had with the code that was provided
	on the instructions, I made sure to copy-paste the code to ensure that the functionalities of the game were present. Additionally, after
	completing the project, I took the time to study the conditions placed in the if-else statements to better understand them. While, I
	had the correct structure for the if-else statements, I unfortunately, did not have the correct conditions placed in the statement. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
	I would love to ask the following questions:
	- Are there any additional projects, or outside sources your team uses to further improve theirweb development skills? 
	- What are the main areas of first-year programming that your team focuses on so I can enhance my skills on those areas? 
	
4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
	The memory game project was a blast to work with. Unfortunately, I reached the 5-hour mark just as I was finishing the game - due to
	taking the time to read each step carfully and studying both the CSS and HTML features that would be added into the game. However, if
	I had more time to work on the project, I would spend the time adding more features, such as adding different color button styles, and
	adding a randomizer to have the project pick a different pattern every time the user starts the game.
